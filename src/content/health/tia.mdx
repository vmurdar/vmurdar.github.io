    <p>Many people who suffer a first-time stroke had a prior warning from a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a ministroke. TIAs can last anywhere from 30 seconds to 20 minutes, although most usually last at least five minutes.</p>

## How to recognize and respond to a "warning" stroke

TIAs can recur with the same symptoms or different ones. The acronym BE-FAST can help people recognize signs and symptoms. Most people experience one or more of these during a TIA.

*   **B: Balance** Balance problems caused by a TIA often make it difficult to stand up, or you may fall to one side.
*   **E: Eyes** The most common vision problem is being unable to see from one or both eyes. Often, people see a dark gray shade that blocks half or all of their vision. Blurred or double vision can also occur.
*   **F: Face** The face may droop on one or both sides. Usually, the corner of the mouth appears pulled down, and the person can't smile normally.
*   **A: Arm weakness** This is the most common symptom and usually occurs on only one side and may also include numbness or tingling.
*   **S: Speech difficulty** Slurred or garbled speech is the most common type of speech problem, but some people struggle to find words or understand what others say. This deficit also extends to writing and texting.
*   **T: Time** This is not a symptom, but a command: it's time to call 911 or go straight to an emergency room, even if the symptoms lasted only one or two minutes.

*Early recognition of the likely cause of a TIA is the best way to prevent a stroke. Because most TIAs are related to a temporary clot forming in a narrowed brain artery, the usual treatment begins with two antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix), or an anticoagulant medication to prevent additional blood clots from forming.*
