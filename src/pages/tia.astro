     <p>Many people who suffer a first-time stroke had a prior warning from a transient ischemic attack (TIA), 
        also known as a ministroke. TIAs can last anywhere from 30 seconds to 20 minutes, although most usually last at least five minutes.</p>

          TIAs can recur with the same symptoms or different ones. The acronym BE-FAST can help people recognize signs and symptoms. 
          Most people experience one or more of these during a TIA

      <li><strong>B: Balance.</strong>Balance problems caused by a TIA often make it difficult to stand up, or you may fall to one side.</li>
      <li><strong>E: Eyes.</strong> The most common vision problem is being unable to see from one or both eyes. Often, people see a dark gray shade that blocks half or all of their vision. Blurred or double vision can also occur./li>
      <li><strong>F: Face.</strong> The face may droop on one or both sides.</li>
      <li><strong>A: Arm weakness.</strong> Usually occurs on only one side.</li>
      <li><strong>S: Speech difficulty.</strong> Slurred or garbled speech is common.</li>
      <li><strong>T: Time.</strong> Call 911 immediately.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>
      Early recognition of the likely cause of a TIA is the best way to prevent a stroke. 
        Because most TIAs are related to a temporary clot forming in a narrowed brain artery, 
        the usual treatment begins with two antiplatelet drugs, 
        such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix), or an anticoagulant medication to prevent additional blood clots 
        from forming.
